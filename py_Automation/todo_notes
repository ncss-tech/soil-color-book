so far this is a brute force approach with no error trapping and not elegant at all...

guts of the script posted, w/ results for 3 small E coast states:

what needs to be worked out
	- nasty pink color represents dominant component series with rgb = ,,, (typically water)
	- no color (white) are dominant component series that did not have an rgb color in Dylan's mined color
		profile---why???
	- suitable resolution (gssurgo(30m), and png image). Significant spatial resolution reduction to handle a CONUS mosaic (to maintain GRID file size capable of handling a colormap)
	- what to do with any water type 
	
if's fully automated for python IDE/arcgis/arcpy install with one click, though paths are hard wired, and gssurgo raster needs to be present

intend to add & open each depth image in GIMP to manipulate nasty pink and white null colors.  Will need to add very small buffered state extents in order to select by rgb to handle the pink-,,, and white-None coolors.  Will be a steep learning curve (GIMP py-fu)
